##Background

The exponential distribution in R is investigated and compared with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

R can simulate exponential distributions with the following function: rexp(n, lambda). The mean of this distribution is $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ where lambda $\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The standard deviation is $\sigma = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

CLT explains that a sample consisting of at least 30 independent observations and fairly normally distributed data, the distribution can be notated as: $\bar{x}_{n}$ ~ $N(\mu, \frac{\sigma }{\sqrt{n}})$. This project will demonstrate that the sampling distribution of an exponential distribution with $n = 40$ 
and $\lambda = 0.2$ is approximately $N(\frac{1}{0.2}, \frac{\frac{1}{0.2}}{\sqrt{40}})$ distributed.

##Simulations
1000 samples of size 40 are drawn from an $Exp(\frac{1}{0.2}, \frac{1}{0.2})$ distribution with the mean being calculated from each sample thus increasing statistical power. Avereging the means from these samples should give a result near 5.

Library(ggplot2)

Create variables
 
Sims <- 1000
  
n <- 40
  
lambda <- 0.2

Set random seed
 
set.seed(12)

Create a matrix rows corresponding to 1000 simulations and columns corresponding to the 40 random simulations.

simMatrix <- matrix(rexp(n = Sims * n, rate = lambda), Sims, n)

Vector containing the value of each simulations mean
  
  simMean <- rowMeans(simulationMatrix)

Create full data frame
  
  simData <- data.frame(cbind(simMatrix, simMean))

Create Visualization
  
  ggplot(data = simData, aes(simData$simuMean)) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(2, 9, by = 0.2), col = "blue", aes(fill = ..count..)) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Mean Distribution", x = "Simulation Means", y = "Frequency") + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(simData$simMean)), color="red", 
  linetype="dashed", size=2)
